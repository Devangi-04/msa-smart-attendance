### **Why Track Missed Events?**
- Identify poorly attended events
- Reschedule important meetings
- Analyze attendance patterns
- Follow up with members

### **Example:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 📅 Statistics Workshop [Missed]  🟠    │
│ 🕐 Oct 15, 2025, 3:00 PM (Past)        │
│ 📍 Computer Lab                          │
│ 👥 Attendance: 0/50                      │
│ ⚠️ No one attended this event           │
│                        [Edit] [Delete]   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## ⚫ Previous Events Feature

### **What are Previous Events?**
- **ALL** past events regardless of:
  - Attendance count
  - Status (done/missed/cancelled)
  - Any other criteria

### **Why View Previous Events?**
- Complete historical record
- Review all past activities
- Generate reports
- Track MSA history

### **Example:**
```
Previous Events and Meetings

📅 MSA General Meeting [Done] ⚫
🕐 Oct 10, 2025 - 45 attendees

📅 Statistics Workshop [Missed] 🟠
🕐 Oct 15, 2025 - 0 attendees

📅 Math Competition [Cancelled] 🔴
🕐 Oct 18, 2025 - Cancelled

📅 Study Session [Done] ⚫
🕐 Oct 19, 2025 - 12 attendees
```

---

## 🎯 Filter Logic

### **Missed Filter:**
```javascript
eventDate < now AND
attendance === 0 AND
status !== 'done' AND
status !== 'cancelled'
```

### **Previous Filter:**
```javascript
eventDate < now
// Shows ALL past events
```

### **Done Filter:**
```javascript
status === 'done' OR
(eventDate < now AND attendance > 0)
```

---

## 🎨 Status Badge System

### **Complete Badge Colors:**

| Status | Badge | Color | When Shown |
|--------|-------|-------|------------|
| Upcoming | 🟢 | Green | Future events |
| Scheduled | 🔵 | Blue | Confirmed |
| Missed | 🟠 | Orange | Past, no attendance |
| Done | ⚫ | Gray | Completed |
| Cancelled | 🔴 | Red | Cancelled |

### **Smart Badge Logic:**
```
IF cancelled → Red "Cancelled"
ELSE IF done OR (past + attendance) → Gray "Done"
ELSE IF past + no attendance → Orange "Missed"
ELSE IF scheduled → Blue "Scheduled"
ELSE IF future → Green "Upcoming"
```
